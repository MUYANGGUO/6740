  Ability to calculate probabilities and apply Bayes’ rule
  
  - Probability :
  
    Discrete Prob. Distribution:
    
    Ex. Bernoulli Distribution 
    
    Ex. Binomial Distribution
    
    Continous Prob. Distribution:
    
    
    [Joint Cumulative Distributions:](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter5/5_2_2_joint_cdf.php)
    
    [Bayes' Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem)
    
    
    
    ... ...
    
   

- Maximum Likelihood

  Ability to derive the log likelihood function and its MLE estimator
  
  - Estimate for parameters in boundary conditons, think about probability density function's decreasing or increasing, locate the MLE estimator by comparing with X_i
  
  - Estimate for parameters in probability density function, suppose n times find the probability for n times trials, and run log scale, do partial derivative with respect to the estimator. 
  

- Clustering

  Understanding of the concept and process of the clustering algorithms such as k-means, spectral clustering and so on.

  Understanding of how different choices (e.g. K, distance metric) will influence the results
  
  - K means
  
  - Spectral Clustering

- PCA

  Understanding of the derivation of principal components 

  Ability to derive principal components from given data

- Expectation Maximization

  Ability to derive the full EM algorithm given a distribution

- Information theory

  Understanding of the Jensen’s inequality and its application

  Ability to calculate entropy and mutual information given the random variables
